![Recording](https://github.com/randomdrake/react-flow-org-chart/blob/main/public/recording.gif?raw=true)

👋 **Hello!** Welcome to a little proof of concept I put together to showcase and practice skills with:

* React
* TypeScript
* JavaScript
* JSX
* Tailwind
* React Flow
* Vite

♻️ This is a straightforward fake org chart generator. It does the following:

* Creates a fake org chart given the number of employees
* Lets you draw org charts vertically or horizontally
* Creates realistic-ish looking organizations with a CEO on the top, managers beneath, and teams of 1-7 people underneath them
* Regenerates with new people every time you redraw / load
* Uses [Faker](https://github.com/faker-js/faker) to generate names, titles, and profile images
* Utilizes [React Flow](https://reactflow.dev/) and the [Dagre](https://github.com/dagrejs/dagre)

## 🏃 Running the App
`npm install` - Install the dependencies

`npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./public/output.css --watch` - Build the Tailwind CSS

`npm run dev` - Run the program using Vite
